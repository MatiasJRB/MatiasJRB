# Hey there! 👋 I'm Matías Ríos

I'm a **Software Engineer** with 4+ years of experience working across different industries, from e-commerce to logistics and healthcare. I’m passionate about **building scalable backend systems**, improving performance, and making things work smoothly. I’ve worked on everything from mobile apps to backend APIs, but my heart lies in crafting clean, efficient, and reliable backend systems.  

When I'm not coding, you'll find me at the gym, playing soccer, or hanging out with friends and family. I also co-run a software venture called **Geome7ric**.
